## Game Overview
Dean's Paranoia is a multiplayer game where players take on the roles of either the dean or mischievous students. The goal is to either catch all the students or successfully escape from the dean, depending on the chosen role.

## Modification of the Original Idea
The original concept was inspired by the game "The Matriarch." However, we decided to customize it to our university setting, adding a comedic twist. The dean must eliminate "bad students" who are up to no good, and the students aim to outsmart the dean.
